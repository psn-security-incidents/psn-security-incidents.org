The hacker (\"Derol Bodden\") contacted him and explained the method: Sony support will transfer full account ownership to anyone who provides the PSN username and any old transaction number — no password, no 2FA check, no identity verification. The transaction number came from a screenshot in a 2023 Numerama article. On the first call to Sony, the agent asked only for the PSN username and a transaction number from any year, then handed back the account in under five minutes. 36 minutes after recovery, the hacker stole it again using the same method. Sony's chat support gave scripted responses and refused to escalate. A second phone agent finally asked proper identity questions (date of birth, original email, original username), proving Sony has the capability but does not enforce it. Sony told Lellouche he should not have published the transaction number and that there is no way to invalidate old transaction IDs. Telegram groups dedicated to mass account theft using this method were identified. The hacker told Lellouche he targeted the account at random looking for a specific game.",

Despite reversing the bank claim and funds being removed from their account in January, Sony refused to lift the suspension for over five months. The user had thousands of hours across games like Dark Souls 3, Destiny, and ESO, and thousands of dollars in digital purchases — all inaccessible.
